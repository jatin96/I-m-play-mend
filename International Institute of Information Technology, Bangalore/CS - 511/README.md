# Course - DSA

This is my solutions to the most famous and acclaimed courses taught at IIIT-B by Prof. V N Muralidhara

## Nomenclature

1. The name of each file starts with the date the problem was taught in the lecture. Each of the day, date and month is separated by an underscore. The second parameter is the problem number. The third argument is the approach listed as app$. The approaches are enumerated in the increasing order of the efficiency in the solution.
2. For each of the file defined in the above point, the problem statement and the approach used with the analysis is stated in each file.
3. For each problem, test files are also provide. The files are in the folder test with the first two arguments same as that of the problems the files are provided for.

Please let me know if you find an error or a better approach.

1. Given an unsorted array with distinct integers and a rank R, find the element having that ranking by using the partition method. The pivot in the partition method should be calculated using the deterministic method by calculating the median of 5 elements. Compare and contrast by making a group of more than 5 elements (7,1000) and less than 5 elements. Compute and compare the running time on file sample1.txt.
