2. Given two binary strings and an integral value denoting the length, find if a pattern of the given length exists in both of the strings or not?
|string1| + |string2| <= 1000000

1. Given an array, create another array which contains the index such that:
* The index is as minimum as possible
* Value at that index >= Value at current index for each valid index in the array.

  For the last element in the array, store the size of the array.

  * Sample Input:
    11
    48 93 12 748 63 7 4 73 98 64 41

  * Sample Output:
    1 3 3 11 7 7 7 8 11 11 11

3. Build a tree having the same Inorder traversal as of the given tree.
4. Build a tree having the same Preorder traversal as of the given tree.
5. Build a tree having the same Postorder traversal as of the given tree.
6. Build a tree out of the given Preorder and Inorder traversals.
7. Build a tree out of the given Postorder and Inorder traversals.
