/*
 * Problem statement: Given an array, create another array which contains the index such that:
 *                -> The index is as minimum as possible
 *                -> Value at that index >= Value at current index for each valid index in the array.
 * Algorithm Used: Stack
 * Worst Case:    O
 * Sample Input: 11
 *               48 93 12 748 63 7 4 73 98 64 41
 * Sample Output: 1 3 3 11 7 7 7 8 11 11 11
